# 🚍 SMART CITY TRANSPORT | Power BI Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview

The **Smart City Transport Dashboard** is an interactive Power BI project designed to analyze and visualize public transport data across multiple city routes.  
The goal is to provide **actionable insights** into total revenue, passenger flow, fuel cost, average delay, and route performance — helping transport authorities make **data-driven operational decisions**.

The dataset was cleaned, modeled, and visualized using **Microsoft Power BI** to deliver clear and effective business insights.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze **Total Revenue**, **Fuel Cost**, and **Passenger Count** by route.  
- Track **Average Delay** per route and identify underperforming areas.  
- Evaluate **Payment Mode Distribution** (Card, Cash, UPI).  
- Visualize **Geographical Locations** of transport stations on the map.  
- Identify **Peak Hour Passenger Load** for better scheduling and route optimization.  


## 📈 Key Insights from Dashboard

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| 💰 **Total Revenue** | 68,645 | Total revenue generated by all routes |
| ⛽ **Total Fuel Cost** | 50,402 | Total fuel expenses incurred |
| 👥 **Total Passengers** | 4,657 | Total passengers served |
| ⏱ **Average Delay** | 6.42 min | Average delay across all routes |

### 🚦 Revenue vs Fuel Cost by Route
- **Route 107** recorded the **highest revenue (7,325)** with a moderate fuel cost.
- **Route 101** had **lower revenue (4,450)** with higher relative fuel expenses.

### 🚌 Revenue by Route
- **Route C** → Highest revenue (19,065)
- **Route D** → Second highest (17,970)
- **Route B** → Moderate (16,785)
- **Route A** → Lowest (14,825)

### ⏳ Average Delay by Route
- Route D: **7.67 min (highest delay)**
- Route B: **7.33 min**
- Route A: **5.67 min**
- Route C: **5.00 min (best performance)**

### 💳 Payment Mode Distribution
- **Card** – 36.72%  
- **Cash** – 34.16%  
- **UPI** – 29.12%

### 🕕 Peak Hour Passenger Load
- Highest passenger count (**1,162**) at **18:00 hrs**
- Noticeable decrease in load during morning and late-night hours.

## 🗺 Geographic Visualization

The dashboard includes an **interactive map** highlighting key transport stations:  
- **Station 1** – Egypt  
- **Station 2** – Norway  
- **Station 3** – Finland  
- **Station 4** – Sweden  

This helps visualize regional transport activity and identify station-wise performance patterns.
